# TinajaApp

Le hablas y te amplifica â€¦ con ecos y aplausos

> This is terrible and magnificent at the same time.

## Functionalities

* Prior artwork: http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/15/montilla-vineyards-sherry-andalucia-spain
* Must work in Firefox OS
* Using getUserMedia, whatever you speak to the device comes back after a bit of delay amplified + with samples of a cheering audience
* UI: a tinaja, with some sort of waves (kinda like wifi) behind. When you speak the waves grow (or not).
* Once you start yelling the tinaja might vibrate
* If you yell too much the tinaja breaks and a message shows up: "too cool for this tinaja, yo". You need to kill the app and restart it again to get a tinaja back
